!!!!THIS IS AN EXPERMENT!!!!!!
!!!DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!!!


The service user runs a simple Wayland server using PAM, it reports itself as a 'greeter' (as it's technically 
graphical in how it interacts with the OS, (over TTY)) instead of TTY. 
Also the single display server runs a full screen program.

- A disconnected 'tmux' session where the login binary runs under. tmux is used as it can emulate /dev/pts/x and can run
  as root, and can be utmp'd for login to work. Many settings in a custom config file had to be turned OFF though, as 
  the panels and the multisessions and windows are too much to be exposed to emulate a login TTY. (as well as the 
  status bar)

- 'cage' is a display server that comes close to what is needed, it runs one program full screen. And exits when the one
  program quits, IT quits too, which is very helpful. It's like wl_fullscreen, but doesn't need a custom protocol. And
  it's built on wlroots, so it had good support. 

- 'alacritty' is a decent enough Terminal Emulator. It doesn't have auto link detection, which is GOOD because it's a
  used as a kiosk. No preferences panels, or context menus that can open a file browser window, etc.

- A 'tmux' connection *client* runs in alacritty, as the user, (which has permissons granted). This is so that the login
  session running as root, needs no SETUID, and so that these UI programs don't run as root.
  Also, since the shell running in the cage session is actually running in tmux, users cannot start graphical programs
  by mistake in the display server, as they don't have permissions, or the WAYLAND_DISPLAY in their environment.

- It needs /dev/dri/card0 but if there isn't, it falls back to legacy.

Problems:
  FBDEV only systems won't work. Whereas 'weston' has fbdev, but doesn't have the special features like 'cage'.
     There are some cards that don't even have fbdev. Odd that there is no VESA-like Kernel Mode Setting driver yet.
     If there is no /dev/dri/card0 then it will fall back
  Sessions won't appear as the user in loginctl, and instead appear as the 'vtty-frontend' user.
  alacritty is rarely packaged, (and needs rust to build)
  cage is rarely packaged
