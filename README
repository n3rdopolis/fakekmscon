!!!!THIS IS AN EXPERMENT!!!!!!
!!!DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!!!


The service user runs a simple Wayland server using PAM, it reports itself as a 'greeter' (as it's technically 
graphical in how it interacts with the OS, (over TTY)) instead of TTY. 
Also the single display server runs a full screen program.

- A disconnected 'socat' server where the /bin/login binary runs under. socat is used as it can emulate /dev/pts/x and can run
  as root, and can be utmp'd for login to work. It runs on the seat-vtty seat so that sessions where XDG_VTNR=0 can work

- 'cage' is a display server that comes close to what is needed, it runs one program full screen. And exits when the one
  program quits, IT quits too, which is very helpful. It's like wl_fullscreen, but doesn't need a custom protocol. And
  it's built on wlroots, so it had good support. 

- 'vte' is the terminal emulator used, it supports options to make it not support opening links, have any menus, or titlebars
  as it's being used as a kiosk here

- A 'socat' connection *client* runs in vte, as a system user, (which has permissons granted), and connects to the socket
  The graphical terminal emulator and display server do not have to run as root.

- It needs /dev/dri/card0 but if there isn't, it falls back to legacy.

Problems:
  - FBDEV only systems won't work. Linux 5.14 is looking to have simpledrm merged, so this issue might be a big deal soon.
  
  - Sessions on the TTY number won't appear as the user in loginctl, and instead appear as the 'vtty' user.

  - vte binary not built in all distros

  - cage is rarely packaged

  - Sometimes after 'chvt X' out of a vTTY, the <enter> key up event never gets sent
