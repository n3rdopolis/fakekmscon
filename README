!!!!THIS IS AN EXPERMENT!!!!!!
!!!DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!!!


The service user runs a simple Wayland server using PAM, it reports itself as a 'greeter' (as it's technically 
graphical in how it interacts with the OS, (over TTY)) instead of TTY. 
Also the single display server runs a full screen program.

- A disconnected 'tmux' session where the login binary runs under. tmux is used as it can emulate /dev/pts/x and can run
  as root, and can be utmp'd for login to work. Many settings in a custom config file had to be turned OFF though, as 
  the panels and the multisessions and windows are too much to be exposed to emulate a login TTY. (as well as the 
  status bar)

- 'cage' is a display server that comes close to what is needed, it runs one program full screen. And exits when the one
  program quits, IT quits too, which is very helpful. It's like wl_fullscreen, but doesn't need a custom protocol. And
  it's built on wlroots, so it had good support. 

- 'vte' is the terminal emulator used, it supports options to make it not support opening links, have any menus, or titlebars
  as it's being used as a kiosk here

- A 'tmux' connection *client* runs in vte, as the user, (which has permissons granted). This is so that the login
  session running as root, needs no SETUID, and so that these UI programs don't run as root.
  Also, since the shell running in the cage session is actually running in tmux, users cannot start graphical programs
  by mistake in the display server, as they don't have permissions, or the WAYLAND_DISPLAY in their environment.

- It needs /dev/dri/card0 but if there isn't, it falls back to legacy.

Problems:
  - FBDEV only systems won't work. Whereas 'weston' has fbdev, but doesn't have the special features like 'cage'.
    There are some cards that don't even have fbdev. Odd that there is no VESA-like Kernel Mode Setting driver yet.
    If there is no /dev/dri/card0 then it will fall back

  - Sessions on the TTY number won't appear as the user in loginctl, and instead appear as the 'vtty-frontend' user.

  - needs a new version of `vte` that supports `--no-decorations` (not released yet, commit fe95bc7af1b0e70c0fc9254d41ed4f15ea0cfbb9)
    and vte binary not built in all distros

  - cage is rarely packaged
  
  - wlroots chvt problem https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/issues/2332 holds down enter

  - /dev/pts/x not in securetty, however pam_securetty seems to be something that only Debian has, which they are phasing out

  - The seat-ness of the TTY sessions is lost. pam_systemd doesn't work, while the tmux service can be run in seat0, valid TTYs are expected.
    a virtual seat could be used... ...but one can't be created without any devices it appears
